This is a NodeJS backend running an Angular 7 application.
To start the NodeJS server we will run either one of these commands - 
  1. npm run dev - uses ts-node to launch the nodeJS backend written in Typescript.
  2. npm run prod - compiles the code to .js files using the command tsc and then runs node ./output/server.js.
  

The backend REST API will be written in Typescript to stay consistent with the Angular frontend.

In Progres.....
